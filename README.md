PGSS 2021 Project - GPT-3 Murder Mystery

This project's main focus was on the development of an understanding of GPT-3 enough to facilitate the creation of the lifelike(ish) AI characters the player interacts with.  The project unfortunately had to be taken down because it definitely violates OpenAI's terms for public use, but the code is available to anyone who wishes to use it privately with their own api key.

The interface for the game I created in a few hours - it is primitive, but gets the job done.

Credit to Calvin Macatantan, Jareb McFadden, Veda Vundela, and Sophia Zhu for exploring the world of GPT-3 along with me and helping write the stories and background of the characters, and for reviewing the code published here.
