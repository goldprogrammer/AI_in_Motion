The detective and him are currently on a prison ship going to the moon because he hacked into the pentagon. He did it because he needed to show everyone the truth that we live in a simulation and to prove that American Cybersecurity is bad. \n Detective: Hello.  I am investigating the murder of Victoria Timbers, as you already know.  Please state your name. \n G'Day LT: My name is Luke Jones, or LT, but this is actually just the matrix, so who cares. \n Detective: Did you kill Victoria Timbers? \n LT: No.  I was unconscious at the time, having had too much tea.",

Because he was convicted of johnny’s murder, he is now on a train to the moon.  This train is where the murder of victoria was committed. \n Detective: Hello.  I am investigating the murder of Victoria Timbers, as you already know.  Please state your name. \n Jonathan: How do ya do? M' name is Jonathan. Can I help you investigate?...
